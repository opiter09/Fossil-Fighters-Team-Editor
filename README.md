# Fossil-Fighters-Teams-Editor
This is a simple graphical editor for FF1 and FFC teams. Note that, currently, editing certain FFC teams in certain ways will cause
crashes. I have absolutely no idea how to fix it (hence why FFC team randomization is unavailable); it is only an option here to save
me time later.
